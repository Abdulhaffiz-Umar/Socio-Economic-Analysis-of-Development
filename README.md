# Socio-economic analysis of development

### Motivation 
This project was inspired by the need to understand development prospects across the world. To this end, data from The Gapminder project was curated to explore how development compares between developing and developed economies. 

**Research Questions** 
* What is the relationship between life expectancy and income?
* How does developed countries and developing countries compare in terms of CO2 emissions?
* Comparison between developing and developed countries in terms of co2 emissions and urban population
* What is the relationship between sustainable development and urban population
* Which countries emit the most carbon

**Dependencies** 
* Numpy 
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**Data** 
The following data was obtained from Gapminder's website:

* GNI per Capita
The GNI (Gross National Income) is the sum of a countryâ€™s gross domestic product (GDP) plus net income (positive or negative) from abroad.

* CO2 emissions per person
Carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (Metric tonnes of C02 per person).

* Sustainable development index
The sustainable development is an efficiency metric designed to access the ecological efficiency of nations to deliver human development.

* Urban population growth
Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. It is calculated using World bank's population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects.

* Life expectancy
The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortalitiy patterns were to stay the same. .

* Income per person
Gross domestic product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power.

* Total population

* Geographic Regions
Data on the six geographic regions of the world

**Summary**

* We observed an increase in population from 1990 till 2018, and a concurrent increase in life expectancy and income europe central Asia and America.
* Africa is still trailing behind in terms of development prospects, athough there is a reasonable increase in life expectancy as was the case 32 years ago.
* Developed countries emit more carbon than developing countries, and there is a downward trend in emissions since 1990
* A strong positive correlation between co2 emissions and gni per capita in developed countries was observed.
* African countries with low gni per capita seem to emit more carbon.
